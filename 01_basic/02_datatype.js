let age = 21 // so here 21 is a number is datatype

let isLoggesIn = true // so here true is a boolean datatype

let state; //  so here we only declare the variable not the data so it is a undefine datatype

console.log(typeof age); // the typeof is used to find the type of the datatype

console.log(typeof null); // if we run this it show the object datatype of the null which is show that js have some limitations 

console.log(typeof undefined); // if we run this show the undefined which is the right type of that
